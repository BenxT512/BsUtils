Overview
BsUtils is a collection of utilities designed for Brawl Stars communities and server admins who want solid data handling, moderation helpers, and community engagement tools. This project focuses on legitimate, ethical use in community spaces—never to manipulate gameplay, boost views, spam friends, or create fake accounts. It provides safe, well-documented components that help you manage communities, collect and analyze data, and build helpful bots for servers and fansites.

This repository embraces open collaboration. It aims to be robust, well-tested, and easy to extend. It does not automate in-game actions, nor does it create or seed accounts. Instead, it offers clean APIs and utilities to work with Brawl Stars data you have legitimate access to, plus modular tools to help communities flourish in a fair, transparent way.

Why BsUtils exists
- Community-focused tooling: Build bots, moderation helpers, and analytics that support healthy communities around Brawl Stars without exploiting the game or its players.
- Safe data handling: Parse, transform, and present data you’re authorized to access. Respect rate limits, privacy, and platform terms.
- Extensible architecture: Add new modules as your community grows. Use clean interfaces and comprehensive tests to keep changes stable.
- Clear documentation: Find practical examples, tutorials, and guidelines that help teams deploy quickly and confidently.

Key goals
- Help admins moderate communities effectively without overstepping privacy boundaries.
- Provide reliable utilities that teams can depend on for analytics, dashboards, and event tracking.
- Encourage safe usage patterns, including rate limiting, auditing, and transparent feature flags.
- Support collaboration through clear contribution guidelines and respectful, inclusive workflows.

Project structure and scope
BsUtils is organized into modules that address common needs in community management and data work around Brawl Stars. Typical modules include:
- DataTools: helpers to work with public data sources, formatters, and simple analytics.
- Moderation: rate limiters, message filters, or queueing helpers to keep chats healthy.
- ServerUtilities: tooling for Discord/Slack/IRC integrations, event scheduling, and logging.
- Utilities: general helpers like time formatting, data structures, and configuration helpers.
- CLI and API bindings: lightweight interfaces to run tasks or expose a small API surface.

Safety and responsible use
This project explicitly avoids any functionality that would:
- Automate gameplay actions in the game client.
- Create fake accounts or automate signups.
- Boost viewers, spam, or harvest contacts.
- Bypass platform safeguards or terms of service.

By design, BsUtils focuses on legitimate community tooling that respects platform policies and player safety. If you are unsure whether a feature is appropriate, ask in issue conversations or discuss changes during a pull request review.

Getting started
This section helps you set up BsUtils in a safe, productive way. You’ll find guidance for different environments and common tasks. The goal is to get you up and running with clear, repeatable steps.

Prerequisites
- A supported runtime (commonly Node.js 18+ for JavaScript/TypeScript projects; adjust if your setup uses a different stack).
- Basic command-line experience.
- Access to your community platform (for example, a Discord server) with proper permissions for bots or automation you intend to run.
- Respect for user privacy and data protection rules relevant to your region and platform.

Installation
There are a few common ways to install BsUtils, depending on how you plan to use it.

From source
- Clone the repository
  - git clone https://github.com/BenxT512/BsUtils.git
  - cd BsUtils
- Install dependencies
  - npm install
  - or yarn install
- Build or run local tasks as described in the docs

As a library (when published)
- npm i bsutils
- Or your preferred package manager’s equivalent
- Then import in your project
  - const { DataTools, Moderation } = require('bsutils');
  - import { DataTools, Moderation } from 'bsutils';

Note: If you plan to use a prebuilt CLI or scripts, follow the instructions in the CLI section below.

Quick start: a minimal example
- DataTools example (JavaScript)
  - const { DataTools } = require('bsutils');
  - const stats = DataTools.computePlayerStats(sampleData);
  - console.log(stats);
- Moderation example (JavaScript)
  - const { Moderation } = require('bsutils');
  - const queue = Moderation.createMessageQueue({ maxSize: 100, cooldownMs: 2000 });
  - queue.enqueue('new message');

These examples illustrate typical usage. Adapt them to your project’s architecture and security requirements. Always ensure you have legitimate access to any data you process and that your tools comply with platform terms of service.

Usage notes and patterns
- Data handling: Use DataTools to sanitize, validate, and transform data before storage or display. Respect privacy and minimize data collection to what’s necessary for your use case.
- Moderation workflows: Build message queues, filters, and audit trails. Keep moderation decisions transparent and reversible where possible.
- Server integrations: Use ServerUtilities to connect your bots or services to your preferred platforms. Prioritize reliability, observability, and rate-limiting to avoid overloading services.
- Localization and accessibility: If your community spans multiple languages, consider exporting data with translations and accessible formats.

Commands, scripts, and workflows
- CLI utilities: If BsUtils ships with a CLI, you can run common tasks directly from the command line. Examples might include:
  - bsutils task:run data-import
  - bsutils moderation:check-queue
  - bsutils export:stats
- Task runners: The project may include a small task runner or scripted jobs. Use a conventional config file (like a YAML or JSON file) to describe schedules, time zones, and environment variables.
- Scheduling: For events or reminders, prefer a robust scheduler with time-zone awareness and persistence, so events don’t get lost if the process restarts.
